reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse.

It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart. With the new API, a significant number of your valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA comes in the form of a widget that you can easily add to your blog, forum, registration form, etc.

To use reCAPTCHA, you need to sign up for an API key pair for your site http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin . The key pair consists of a site key and secret. The site key is used to display the widget on your site. The secret authorizes communication between your application backend and the reCAPTCHA server to verify the user's response. The secret needs to be kept safe for security purposes.
